As there is no latent heat to remove, the total capacity will be between 73% and 78% of the nominal capacity of the system."

            "If the system is keeping up with the space cooling requirements, change the profile to the next higher condenser SEER rating, or benchmark the system to clear out the troubleshooting flag. The condenser is engineered to reject the heat of both the sensible and latent loads, and because there is no latent heat to reject, the condenser is effectively oversized for the total quantity of heat being rejected giving the systems characteristics of a higher efficiency condenser.",
            "If the sensible capacity is too low, and the system cannot keep up with the space requirements, the airflow will need to be increased to achieve total capacity. Typical airflows per ton for systems engineered for high sensible capacity are 450-525 CFM/Ton. If the system is not able to satisfy the space cooling requirements, and everything else is normal, the airflow may need to be increased by increasing the fan speed, reducing duct restrictions, using a less restrictive filter, increasing the blower size, or making duct modifications to handle the higher airflow requirements. In rare cases, the system may not have been properly sized for the space cooling requirements."

As there is no latent heat to remove, the total capacity will be between 73% and 78% of the nominal capacity of the system."

        "Recommendations": [
            "If the system is keeping up with the space cooling requirements, change the profile to the next higher condenser SEER rating, or benchmark the system to clear out the troubleshooting flag. The condenser is engineered to reject the heat of both the sensible and latent loads, and because there is no latent heat to reject, the condenser is effectively oversized for the total quantity of heat being rejected giving the systems characteristics of a higher efficiency condenser.",
            "If the sensible capacity is too low, and the system cannot keep up with the space requirements, the airflow will need to be increased to achieve total capacity. Typical airflows per ton for systems engineered for high sensible capacity are 450-525 CFM/Ton. If the system is not able to satisfy the space cooling requirements, and everything else is normal, the airflow may need to be increased by increasing the fan speed, reducing duct restrictions, using a less restrictive filter, increasing the blower size, or making duct modifications to handle the higher airflow requirements. In rare cases, the system may not have been properly sized for the space cooling requirements."
